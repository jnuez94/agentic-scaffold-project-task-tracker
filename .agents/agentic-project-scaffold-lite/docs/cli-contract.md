# Coordination CLI Contract

Contract version: `1.2.0`.

This document defines the stable public machine interface for the
harness-neutral SQLite coordination CLI. Version 1.2.0 preserves every 1.1.0
command, result shape, error, exit code, schema-v1 rule, and actor/session
semantic. The task assignment, content-update, and explicit release commands
described below are additive.

## Supported Environment

- one local machine
- one SQLite database shared by participating local processes
- Python 3.10 or newer
- no third-party Python runtime dependencies
- a filesystem that supports POSIX advisory locks and atomic same-directory
  replacement
- trusted local operating-system users
- no secrets, credentials, regulated data, or unapproved proprietary data

The CLI does not provide network synchronization, authentication, or
authorization. Network filesystems and independent project clones are not a
supported way to share the database.

## Invocation And Discovery

The installed executable is:

```sh
./.agents/agentic-project-scaffold-lite/bin/coordination
```

Global options must precede the command:

```text
coordination [--db PATH] [--session ID] COMMAND ...
```

- `--db PATH` selects an explicit database. Inside a configured coordination
  project it may name that project's configured main database or an alternate
  database whose complete operational namespace is disjoint. It cannot name
  managed metadata or reinterpret the configured database's main, sidecar,
  journal, or advisory-lock roles.
- Without `--db`, the CLI searches the current directory and then each parent
  for the nearest `.coordination/config.yml`.
- `init` in a current directory that has no configuration may create or
  revalidate the default `.coordination/coordination.sqlite3`; this remains
  retry-safe. Other commands, and incomplete ancestor boundaries, require
  `config.yml`.
- An existing nearest `.coordination` component must be a real directory, and
  an existing `config.yml` at that boundary must be a non-symbolic-link regular
  file. An encountered `.coordination/` directory with no `config.yml`, or any
  other malformed nearer boundary, is rejected rather than skipped in favor of
  a parent project.
- A discovered configuration consists of blank lines, comments, or unique
  `key: value` scalar lines. Leading and trailing line whitespace is ignored.
  It must contain `version: 1`, select `backend: sqlite`, contain exactly one
  nonempty `database` value, and resolve that value to a file below the same
  `.coordination/` directory.
- The configured database value is relative, contains neither `..` nor a
  nested `.coordination` path component, does not traverse symbolic links, and
  cannot begin with the managed root names `config.yml`, `README.md`, or
  `backups`. These component reservations are case-insensitive so the contract
  is consistent across filesystems. Existing intermediate components must be
  directories.
- `--session ID` selects an execution session for mutation attribution.
- `COORDINATION_SESSION` supplies the default session when `--session` is
  absent.
- An explicit option overrides its environment default.
- Long options do not accept unambiguous abbreviations.

`COORDINATION_BUSY_TIMEOUT_MS` controls the wait for SQLite and operational
file locks. It defaults to `5000` and accepts decimal integers from `0` through
`60000`. Invalid environment configuration returns `configuration_error`.

The installed launcher imports only the sibling bundled `lib/coordination`
package. The repository root `coordination/` directory is the sole
implementation copied by the installer. Missing or unimportable installed
runtime modules return JSON `installation_error` on stderr with exit code 5,
without a Python traceback.

## Lexical And Size Limits

Arguments are validated before database mutation.

| Domain | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| Identifier | 1-128 ASCII characters; first character is a letter or digit; remaining characters are letters, digits, `.`, `_`, `:`, `@`, `+`, or `-` |
| Required text | 1-65,536 valid Unicode scalar values after requiring at least one non-whitespace character; content is preserved; NUL is rejected |
| Optional text | 0-65,536 valid Unicode scalar values; content is preserved; NUL is rejected |
| Path | 1-4,096 valid Unicode scalar values with at least one non-whitespace character; NUL is rejected |
| Revision | Integer from 1 through 2,147,483,647 |
| List limit | Integer from 1 through 500; default 100 |
| List offset | Integer from 0 through 2,147,483,647; default 0 |
| Health stale days | Integer from 0 through 3,650; default 7 |
| Health stale-session minutes | Integer from 0 through 5,256,000; default 60 |
| Recovery stale seconds | Integer from 0 through 315,360,000; default 3,600 |
| Priority | Integer from 1 through 5; default 3 |

Identifiers are rejected rather than trimmed or rewritten. Required and
optional text retain leading and trailing whitespace after validation.
Repeated `--assignee`, `--task`, and `--reviewer` values must be unique.

File input and output paths must not alias the configured database, managed
configuration or README, database journal, WAL or shared-memory sidecar,
advisory lock, or another protected operational path. Restore input and
backup/export output must be regular files when they already exist.
Directories and special files are rejected. Case variants of protected
operational filenames are also
reserved so behavior remains safe on case-insensitive filesystems. An explicit
`--db` may name an absent destination for `init` or `restore`, but an existing
database target must be a non-symbolic-link regular file. Discovered configured
targets enforce the same file-type rule. Live database files with hard-link
aliases are rejected because each database must have one canonical operational
path and lock namespace. WAL, shared-memory, rollback-journal, and advisory-lock
files must likewise be non-symbolic-link regular files with no hard-link
aliases; sidecars for an absent database are rejected as stale.
Restore additionally requires the complete source and target operational path
sets to be disjoint; no database, WAL, shared-memory, journal, or lock name in
one namespace may alias any such name in the other. A backup output is also a
database namespace and must be completely disjoint from its source.

## JSON And Stream Contract

Successful machine-readable commands write exactly one JSON value followed by
a newline to standard output:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": {}
}
```

Expected failures write exactly one JSON value followed by a newline to
standard error and do not write a success value:

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "stable_snake_case_code",
    "message": "Human-readable explanation",
    "details": {}
  }
}
```

`details` is omitted when no structured detail exists. Consumers must branch on
`error.code`, not `message`. JSON key ordering, indentation, and message text
are not contractual. Field names, JSON value types, nullability, array
contents, and documented ordering are contractual.

The only non-JSON success output is:

- `--help`, which writes human-readable command help
- `export` without `--output`, which writes only a Markdown report

Timestamps are UTC ISO 8601 strings at one-second resolution with a `+00:00`
offset. Integer database keys are JSON numbers. Nullable database values are
JSON `null`.

## Exit Codes

| Exit | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | Success |
| `1` | Unexpected internal failure |
| `2` | Invalid arguments, missing required attribution, or missing destructive confirmation |
| `3` | Requested resource, input, or database not found |
| `4` | State conflict, uniqueness conflict, existing output, or constraint violation |
| `5` | Installation, configuration, schema, integrity, database, interruption, filesystem, restore, or environment failure |
| `6` | SQLite busy timeout or operational advisory-lock timeout |

## Actor And Session Semantics

An actor ID is a durable accountable identity. `actor_type` describes whether
that identity is an `ai`, `human`, or `service`. A session records the harness
and optional model for one execution. Harness or model names are not actor
identity.

Every audited mutation requires an existing active actor. The actor is resolved
as follows:

| Command | Accountable actor |
| --- | --- |
| `agent add` | `--actor`, or new `--id` when omitted |
| `agent update` | `--actor`, or target agent ID when omitted |
| `session start` | `--agent` |
| `session heartbeat`, `session end` | agent stored on the session |
| `session recover` | required `--actor` |
| `task create`, `task assign`, `task update`, `task status`, `task release` | required `--actor` |
| `task claim` | required `--agent` |
| `evidence add`, `dependency add`, `dependency resolve` | required `--actor` |
| `review add` | required `--reviewer` |
| `decision add` | required `--owner` |
| `message send` | required `--sender` |
| `artifact add` | required `--owner` |
| `artifact status` | required `--actor` |
| `escalation add` | required `--raised-by` |
| `escalation resolve` | required `--actor` |
| `restore` | required `--actor`, which must be active in the restore input |

`init`, queries, diagnostics, export, and backup do not append an actor audit.

When a global session is present for an audited mutation, it must exist, be
active, belong to the accountable actor, and belong to an active agent.
Successful session-aware mutations update `last_seen_at`. A wrong actor/session
pair is a conflict; an unknown referenced resource is not found. `task claim`
always requires a session. Leaving off a session on other mutations is allowed
and produces a null `audit_log.session_id`.

`session start` is the one lifecycle special case: its start audit is
attributed to the newly inserted session itself. `session heartbeat` and
`session end` use their positional session ID. A global session is not used by
those three commands. `session recover` may use a global operator session, but
that session must differ from the session being recovered.

## Pagination And Ordering

Every command named `list` accepts:

```text
[--limit LIMIT] [--offset OFFSET]
```

The defaults are `--limit 100 --offset 0`; the maximum limit is 500. Filtering
occurs before ordering, then offset and limit are applied. A page past the end
is `data: []`. List results are arrays directly under `data`; there is no
implicit total count.

Ordering is deterministic:

| Command | Order |
| --- | --- |
| `agent list` | `role`, `id` |
| `session list` | `started_at`, `id` |
| `task list` | `priority`, `updated_at`, `id` |
| `evidence list` | `created_at`, `id` |
| `review list` | `created_at`, `id` |
| `decision list` | `created_at`, `id` |
| `message list` | `created_at`, `id` |
| `artifact list` | `updated_at`, `id` |
| `escalation list` | `created_at`, `id` |

Nested task evidence and reviews use `created_at`, `id`; dependencies use
`depends_on_task_id`, `dependency_type`. Identifier arrays use ascending
identifier order.

## Common Row Shapes

Query commands return the stored columns listed here. Extra fields are listed
with the relevant command.

| Row | Fields and JSON types |
| --- | --- |
| Agent | `id`, `name`, `role`, `actor_type`, `status`, `responsibilities`, `goal`, `operating_style`, `decision_authority`, `review_authority`, `escalation_rules`, `unavailable_for`, `created_at`, `updated_at`: strings |
| Session | `id`, `agent_id`, `harness`, `model`, `status`, `started_at`, `last_seen_at`: strings; `ended_at`: string or null |
| Task | `id`, `title`, `description`, `status`, `tags`, `acceptance_criteria`, `next_steps`, `blocked_claims`, `notes`, `created_at`, `updated_at`: strings; `priority`, `revision`: integers; `created_by`: string |
| Evidence | `id`: integer; `task_id`, `uri`, `evidence_type`, `added_by`, `created_at`: strings |
| Dependency | `task_id`, `depends_on_task_id`, `dependency_type`, `status`, `rationale`, `created_at`: strings |
| Review | `id`, `reviewer_id`, `artifact_uri`, `scope`, `decision`, `accepted_items`, `required_changes`, `remaining_risks`, `blocked_claims`, `follow_up_tasks`, `created_at`: strings; `task_id`: string or null |
| Decision | `id`, `title`, `owner_id`, `status`, `context`, `decision`, `options_considered`, `implications`, `evidence`, `blocked_claims`, `review_required`, `created_at`, `updated_at`: strings |
| Message | `id`, `sender_id`, `recipient`, `body`, `tags`, `created_at`: strings; `task_id`: string or null |
| Artifact | `id`, `uri`, `owner_id`, `type`, `status`, `usage_boundaries`, `created_at`, `updated_at`: strings |
| Escalation | `id`, `raised_by`, `owner`, `status`, `related_tasks`, `issue`, `requested_decision`, `resolution`, `follow_up_tasks`, `created_at`, `updated_at`: strings; `needed_by`: string or null |

Fields created through the stable CLI that name an actor are non-null. Direct
database writes remain unsupported even when a column is nullable for delete
semantics or defensive compatibility.

## Command Reference

Notation: brackets mean optional syntax; `...` after an option means it is
repeatable. Defaults are stated explicitly. Every command also accepts the
global options described above.

### Initialization And Diagnostics

```text
init
```

`data`:

```json
{
  "database": "/absolute/path/coordination.sqlite3",
  "schema_version": 1,
  "status": "initialized"
}
```

`status` is `initialized` when an empty database is created and `ready` when an
exact schema version 1 database is verified. `init` never adopts or changes an
unknown nonempty schema.

```text
version
```

This command does not discover or open a database.

```json
{
  "cli_version": "1.2.0",
  "schema_version": 1
}
```

```text
doctor
```

On success, every value has the exact type and successful value shown:

```json
{
  "healthy": true,
  "cli_version": "1.2.0",
  "database": "/absolute/path/coordination.sqlite3",
  "database_writable": true,
  "directory_writable": true,
  "busy_timeout_ms": 5000,
  "foreign_keys": true,
  "integrity_check": "ok",
  "foreign_key_check": "ok",
  "coordination_invariants": "ok",
  "journal_mode": "wal",
  "metadata_schema_version": 1,
  "schema_version": 1,
  "synchronous": "full"
}
```

`busy_timeout_ms` reflects configuration rather than always being 5000.
Unhealthy diagnostics fail instead of returning `healthy: false`.

### Agents

```text
agent add
  --id ID
  --name TEXT
  --role TEXT
  [--actor-type ai|human|service]
  [--responsibilities TEXT]
  [--goal TEXT]
  [--operating-style TEXT]
  [--decision-authority TEXT]
  [--review-authority TEXT]
  [--escalation-rules TEXT]
  [--unavailable-for TEXT]
  [--actor ID]
```

`--actor-type` defaults to `ai`; every optional text field defaults to `""`.
When `--actor` is omitted, the newly created ID is the actor, allowing the
first actor to bootstrap itself. A supplied `--actor` may equal the new ID;
any other supplied actor must already exist and be active.

```json
{"id": "actor-id", "actor_type": "ai", "status": "created"}
```

```text
agent list
  [--all]
  [--actor-type ai|human|service]
  [--limit LIMIT]
  [--offset OFFSET]
```

Without `--all`, only active agents are returned. `data` is an array of Agent
rows.

```text
agent update ID
  [--name TEXT]
  [--role TEXT]
  [--actor-type ai|human|service]
  [--status active|inactive]
  [--actor ID]
```

At least one changed field is required. An agent with an active session cannot
be made inactive. The target agent is the default accountable actor, so
reactivating an inactive target requires a different active `--actor`.
`data` is the complete updated Agent row.

### Sessions

```text
session start
  --id ID
  --agent ID
  --harness TEXT
  [--model TEXT]
```

`--model` defaults to `""`.

```json
{
  "id": "session-id",
  "agent_id": "actor-id",
  "harness": "harness-name",
  "model": "",
  "status": "active"
}
```

```text
session list
  [--agent ID]
  [--status active|ended]
  [--harness TEXT]
  [--limit LIMIT]
  [--offset OFFSET]
```

`data` is an array of Session rows.

```text
session heartbeat ID
```

```json
{"id": "session-id", "status": "active"}
```

```text
session end ID
```

The session must be active and have no active task claims.

```json
{"id": "session-id", "status": "ended"}
```

```text
session recover ID
  --actor ID
  --reason TEXT
  [--stale-after-seconds SECONDS]
```

The stale threshold defaults to 3600 seconds. The reason must contain
non-whitespace text. The session must be active and have `last_seen_at` at or
before the calculated cutoff.

```json
{
  "id": "session-id",
  "previous_status": "active",
  "status": "ended",
  "recovered_tasks": [
    {"id": "TASK-1", "status": "blocked", "revision": 3}
  ]
}
```

`recovered_tasks` is ordered by task ID. Recovery atomically blocks every task
claimed by that session, increments each revision, appends the reason to notes,
removes claims, ends the session, and audits the intervention.

### Tasks

```text
task create
  --id ID
  --title TEXT
  --actor ID
  [--description TEXT]
  [--priority 1|2|3|4|5]
  [--tags TEXT]
  [--acceptance TEXT]
  [--next-steps TEXT]
  [--blocked-claims TEXT]
  [--assignee ID]...
```

Priority defaults to 3; optional text defaults to `""`. Assignees default to an
empty array and must be unique active or inactive existing actors.

```json
{
  "id": "TASK-1",
  "status": "todo",
  "revision": 1,
  "assignees": ["actor-a", "actor-b"]
}
```

`assignees` is sorted by actor ID.

```text
task list
  [--status todo|in_progress|review|blocked|done]
  [--assignee ID]
  [--limit LIMIT]
  [--offset OFFSET]
```

Each element contains the Task row plus:

```json
{
  "claimed_by": null,
  "claim_session_id": null,
  "claimed_at": null,
  "assignees": [],
  "evidence_count": 0
}
```

The claim fields are strings when a claim exists. `assignees` is a sorted array
of actor IDs, never a comma-delimited string.

```text
task show ID
```

`data` contains the same Task and aggregate fields as `task list`, plus:

```json
{
  "evidence": [],
  "dependencies": [],
  "reviews": []
}
```

The arrays contain Evidence, Dependency, and Review rows with the deterministic
ordering defined above.

```text
task assign ID
  --actor ID
  --if-revision REVISION
  [--add ID]...
  [--remove ID]...
```

At least one add or remove is required, the two sets cannot overlap, and a
current claim owner cannot be removed. A successful change increments the
revision and returns the sorted complete assignee array:

```json
{
  "id": "TASK-1",
  "revision": 2,
  "assignees": ["actor-a", "actor-b"]
}
```

```text
task update ID
  --actor ID
  --if-revision REVISION
  [--title TEXT]
  [--description TEXT]
  [--priority 1|2|3|4|5]
  [--tags TEXT]
  [--acceptance TEXT]
  [--next-steps TEXT]
  [--blocked-claims TEXT]
```

At least one content field is required. Workflow status and claim ownership
cannot be changed by this command. A successful update increments the revision:

```json
{
  "id": "TASK-1",
  "revision": 3,
  "updated_fields": ["description", "title"]
}
```

```text
task claim ID
  --agent ID
  --if-revision REVISION
```

A global active session is required. The task must be `todo`, `review`, or
`blocked`. A successful new claim returns:

```json
{
  "id": "TASK-1",
  "status": "in_progress",
  "revision": 2,
  "agent": "actor-id",
  "session_id": "session-id",
  "claimed": true,
  "idempotent_replay": false
}
```

Retrying the same agent/session claim with the original revision after its
commit returns the same shape with `claimed: false`,
`idempotent_replay: true`, and the committed revision. It does not mutate state
again.

```text
task status ID STATUS
  --actor ID
  --if-revision REVISION
  [--note TEXT]
```

`STATUS` is one of `todo`, `in_progress`, `review`, `blocked`, or `done`.
`--note` defaults to `""`. Entering `in_progress` is rejected; use
`task claim`. When leaving `in_progress`, the actor and global session must own
the claim; omitting that global session returns `session_required`.

```json
{
  "id": "TASK-1",
  "previous_status": "in_progress",
  "status": "review",
  "revision": 3
}
```

```text
task release ID
  --to todo|review|blocked
  --actor ID
  --if-revision REVISION
  [--note TEXT]
```

This is an explicit spelling of an owned transition out of `in_progress`.
The accountable actor and global session must own the claim. Its result,
revision behavior, and errors are identical to the equivalent `task status`
transition.

Allowed status transitions are:

| From | To |
| --- | --- |
| `todo` | `in_progress`, `blocked` |
| `in_progress` | `todo`, `review`, `blocked` |
| `review` | `in_progress`, `blocked`, `done` |
| `blocked` | `todo`, `in_progress` |
| `done` | none |

Transitioning to the current status is a conflict. Transitioning to `done`
requires at least one evidence row. Every task starts at revision 1; successful
claim and status operations increment it. A stale revision fails before any
partial mutation.

### Evidence And Dependencies

```text
evidence add
  --task ID
  --uri TEXT
  --actor ID
  [--type TEXT]
```

`--type` defaults to `artifact`.

```json
{"id": 1, "task_id": "TASK-1", "status": "created"}
```

```text
evidence list
  --task ID
  [--limit LIMIT]
  [--offset OFFSET]
```

`data` is an array of Evidence rows. The referenced task must exist even when
it has no evidence.

```text
dependency add
  --task ID
  --depends-on ID
  --actor ID
  [--type blocks|informs|review_required|evidence_required]
  [--rationale TEXT]
```

`--type` defaults to `blocks`; `--rationale` defaults to `""`. Both tasks must
exist and differ.

```json
{
  "task_id": "TASK-1",
  "depends_on": "TASK-0",
  "type": "blocks",
  "status": "active"
}
```

```text
dependency resolve
  --task ID
  --depends-on ID
  --actor ID
  [--type blocks|informs|review_required|evidence_required]
```

`--type` defaults to `blocks`. The success shape matches `dependency add` with
`status: "resolved"`.

### Reviews And Decisions

```text
review add
  --id ID
  [--task ID]
  --reviewer ID
  --artifact TEXT
  --scope TEXT
  --decision accepted|conditionally_accepted|changes_requested|rejected
  [--accepted-items TEXT]
  [--required-changes TEXT]
  [--risks TEXT]
  [--blocked-claims TEXT]
  [--follow-up-tasks TEXT]
```

Optional text defaults to `""`; omitted `--task` is stored as null.

```json
{"id": "REV-1", "decision": "accepted", "status": "created"}
```

```text
review list
  [--task ID]
  [--limit LIMIT]
  [--offset OFFSET]
```

`data` is an array of Review rows.

```text
decision add
  --id ID
  --title TEXT
  --owner ID
  [--status proposed|accepted|superseded|rejected]
  --context TEXT
  --decision TEXT
  [--options TEXT]
  [--implications TEXT]
  [--evidence TEXT]
  [--blocked-claims TEXT]
  [--review-required TEXT]
```

Status defaults to `proposed`; optional text defaults to `""`.

```json
{"id": "DEC-1", "status": "proposed"}
```

```text
decision list
  [--limit LIMIT]
  [--offset OFFSET]
```

`data` is an array of Decision rows.

### Messages, Artifacts, And Escalations

```text
message send
  --id ID
  --sender ID
  --recipient TEXT
  [--task ID]
  --body TEXT
  [--tags TEXT]
```

`--tags` defaults to `""`; omitted `--task` is stored as null.

```json
{"id": "MSG-1", "status": "sent"}
```

```text
message list
  [--recipient TEXT]
  [--limit LIMIT]
  [--offset OFFSET]
```

Without a recipient, all messages are returned. With a recipient, results
include messages addressed to that recipient or to the literal recipient
`team`. `data` is an array of Message rows.

```text
artifact add
  --id ID
  --uri TEXT
  --owner ID
  --type TEXT
  [--status draft|review|accepted|superseded]
  [--usage-boundaries TEXT]
  [--task ID]...
  [--reviewer ID]...
```

Status defaults to `draft`; usage boundaries default to `""`. Task and reviewer
values must be unique.

```json
{"id": "ART-1", "status": "draft"}
```

```text
artifact list
  [--status draft|review|accepted|superseded]
  [--limit LIMIT]
  [--offset OFFSET]
```

Each element contains the Artifact row plus:

```json
{"related_tasks": ["TASK-1"], "reviewers": ["reviewer-id"]}
```

Both fields are sorted JSON arrays, never comma-delimited strings.

```text
artifact status ID STATUS
  --actor ID
```

`STATUS` is `draft`, `review`, `accepted`, or `superseded`.

```json
{"id": "ART-1", "status": "accepted"}
```

```text
escalation add
  --id ID
  --raised-by ID
  --owner TEXT
  [--related-tasks TEXT]
  [--needed-by TEXT]
  --issue TEXT
  --requested-decision TEXT
```

Related tasks default to `""`; needed-by defaults to null.

```json
{"id": "ESC-1", "status": "open"}
```

```text
escalation list
  [--status open|in_review|resolved|closed_no_action]
  [--limit LIMIT]
  [--offset OFFSET]
```

`data` is an array of Escalation rows.

```text
escalation resolve ID
  --resolution TEXT
  --actor ID
  [--status resolved|closed_no_action]
  [--follow-up-tasks TEXT]
```

Status defaults to `resolved`; follow-up tasks default to `""`.

```json
{"id": "ESC-1", "status": "resolved"}
```

### Health And Export

```text
health
  [--stale-days DAYS]
  [--stale-session-minutes MINUTES]
  [--limit LIMIT]
```

Defaults are 7 days, 60 minutes, and 100 rows per section. Each section is
queried independently at one coherent database snapshot and capped at the
limit:

```json
{
  "healthy": false,
  "unowned_tasks": [],
  "stale_tasks": [],
  "stale_sessions": [],
  "unclaimed_in_progress_tasks": [],
  "invalid_active_claims": [],
  "active_blockers": [],
  "done_without_evidence": [],
  "open_escalations": [],
  "truncated_sections": ["stale_tasks"]
}
```

`healthy` is true only when every section has zero findings. Because every
nonempty section returns at least its first row, truncation cannot hide an
unhealthy result. `truncated_sections` is a deterministic array in the section
order shown and names each section for which additional rows exist. It is
always present, including as `[]`.

Section element shapes are exact:

- `unowned_tasks`, `stale_tasks`, `unclaimed_in_progress_tasks`,
  `active_blockers`, and `done_without_evidence` contain stored Task rows
  without task-list aggregate fields.
- `stale_sessions` contains Session rows.
- `invalid_active_claims` contains string fields `task_id`, `agent_id`,
  `session_id`, `claimed_at`, `task_status`, `session_status`,
  `session_agent_id`, and `agent_status`.
- `open_escalations` contains Escalation rows.

```text
export
  [--output PATH]
  [--force]
```

Without `--output`, success writes the Markdown report rather than JSON. With
`--output`, success atomically publishes the report and returns:

```json
{"output": "/absolute/path/report.md", "tasks": 42}
```

Stored text is rendered as Markdown text, not report syntax. Headings, list
markers, code delimiters, links, HTML, and embedded newlines cannot inject
additional report structure.

An existing destination is rejected unless `--force` is supplied. Without
`--force`, publication is atomic no-clobber even if another process creates the
destination concurrently.

Backup and file-export outputs, including their derived publication-lock
paths, cannot alias the selected source database's operational namespace.
When an output is inside a `.coordination/` tree with a valid `config.yml`, it
also cannot alias that project's configured main database, WAL, shared-memory,
journal, or advisory-lock path—even when a different database was selected
with `--db`. Direct replacement of configured state is a restore-only
operation. The names `config.yml` and `README.md` are reserved as metadata only
inside `.coordination/` trees; ordinary sibling files with those names remain
valid for standalone explicit databases.

### Backup And Restore

```text
backup
  --output PATH
  [--force]
```

Backup uses SQLite's online backup operation, validates exact schema identity,
integrity, foreign keys, and coordination invariants, and publishes a mode
`0600` file atomically. An existing destination is rejected unless `--force`
is supplied. Publication holds both an output lock and the destination
database's exclusive operational lock. Existing destination WAL,
shared-memory, or journal sidecars are rejected rather than discarded.

```json
{
  "backup": "/absolute/path/backup.sqlite3",
  "bytes": 131072,
  "schema_version": 1,
  "source": "/absolute/path/coordination.sqlite3",
  "verified": true
}
```

```text
restore
  --input PATH
  --actor ID
  --force
```

`--force` is mandatory destructive confirmation. Restore validates the input
and actor before staging. It obtains an exclusive operational lock and rejects
active sessions in the current target. A healthy existing target receives a
verified pre-restore safety backup under the discovered project's root
`.coordination/backups/`. For an explicit `--db` outside any
`.coordination/` directory, the safety directory is `backups/` beside that
database; an explicit target cannot itself alias that fallback directory.
An explicit restore target inside a `.coordination/` tree cannot name its
managed `config.yml` or `README.md`, or a sidecar, journal, or advisory lock of
the database selected by that root's configuration. Rejection details identify
the target and protected path, and publication has not begun.

A restore input inside a configured coordination project may be that
project's configured main database, in which case its actual advisory lock is
used, or a fully disjoint database. It cannot reinterpret managed metadata or
a configured sidecar, journal, or lock as an independent input database.

Restore builds a staged database through SQLite's online backup operation,
inserts the restore audit into staged state, verifies that audit and all
database checks, then atomically replaces the target. Success returns:

```json
{
  "database": "/absolute/path/coordination.sqlite3",
  "restored_from": "/absolute/path/backup.sqlite3",
  "safety_backup": "/absolute/path/backups/pre-restore-TIMESTAMP.sqlite3",
  "safety_backup_verified": true,
  "schema_version": 1,
  "verified": true,
  "publication": "atomic_replace",
  "audit_recorded": true,
  "rollback_performed": false
}
```

`safety_backup` and `safety_backup_verified` are null only when no target
existed. A healthy target always produces a verified safety backup. If an
unreadable target can only be preserved byte-for-byte, the safety path is
reported with `safety_backup_verified: false` rather than being described as a
verified database.

The restore actor, and the global session when supplied, are resolved against
the restore input because that is the state being published and audited.

Expected validation, staging, and publication failures leave the target
unchanged. A postpublication verification failure restores the safety state
and returns `restore_verification_failed` with this details contract:

```json
{
  "database": "/absolute/path/coordination.sqlite3",
  "safety_backup": "/absolute/path/backups/pre-restore-TIMESTAMP.sqlite3",
  "rollback_performed": true,
  "rollback_succeeded": true,
  "rollback_verified": true
}
```

`safety_backup` is string or null. `rollback_verified` is true for a previously
healthy or previously absent target. It may be false when rollback can prove
only byte preservation of a previously unreadable target.
`rollback_succeeded` states whether the rollback operation itself completed;
when it is false, `rollback_verified` is also false and the target requires
operator inspection.

If the staged restore audit cannot be read back before publication,
`restore_audit_failed` reports `database`, `restored_from`,
`target_unchanged: true`, and `reason`. If the atomic replacement itself
fails, `restore_publication_failed` reports `database`, `safety_backup`,
`target_unchanged: true`, and `reason`.

All other coordination processes must remain stopped until restore completes.
Callers must run `doctor` after restore and retain the safety backup until the
restored state is accepted.

## Schema Version 1

Schema version 1 is the first supported SQLite schema. Both
`PRAGMA user_version` and `metadata.schema_version` equal `1`. Version 1.2.0
does not migrate databases created by builds before the stable 1.1.0 contract.

The exact SQL definitions and non-internal object set in `sqlite/schema.sql`
are normative. Runtime schema validation compares every table, explicit index,
and trigger definition with that installed canonical schema; matching names
with different definitions, additional tables, indexes, triggers, or views,
and missing objects are rejected. `init` creates schema version 1 only in a
database with user version zero and no non-internal schema objects; otherwise
the database must already be an exact supported schema.

### Tables

`!` means `NOT NULL`, `?` means nullable, and quoted values are defaults.

| Table | Columns |
| --- | --- |
| `metadata` | `key TEXT! PRIMARY KEY`, `value TEXT!` |

| `task_dependencies` | `task_id TEXT!`, `depends_on_task_id TEXT!`, `dependency_type TEXT!`, `status TEXT! "active"`, `rationale TEXT! ""`, `created_at TEXT!`; composite primary key `(task_id, depends_on_task_id, dependency_type)` |

| `artifact_tasks` | `artifact_id TEXT!`, `task_id TEXT!`; composite primary key `(artifact_id, task_id)` |
| `artifact_reviewers` | `artifact_id TEXT!`, `reviewer_id TEXT!`; composite primary key `(artifact_id, reviewer_id)` |
| `escalations` | `id TEXT! PRIMARY KEY`, `raised_by TEXT!`, `owner TEXT!`, `status TEXT! "open"`, `related_tasks TEXT! ""`, `needed_by TEXT?`, `issue TEXT!`, `requested_decision TEXT!`, `resolution TEXT! ""`, `follow_up_tasks TEXT! ""`, `created_at TEXT!`, `updated_at TEXT!` |

The schema directly enforces identifier grammar on durable entity IDs and
directly bounds the required text columns shown with `CHECK` clauses in
`sqlite/schema.sql`. The CLI additionally applies the public size,
Unicode-scalar, and NUL rules to every text argument before persistence;
direct database writes are unsupported. Status and type checks are:

- actor type: `ai`, `human`, `service`
- agent status: `active`, `inactive`
- session status: `active`, `ended`
- task status: `todo`, `in_progress`, `review`, `blocked`, `done`
- priority: 1 through 5
- dependency type: `blocks`, `informs`, `review_required`,
  `evidence_required`
- dependency status: `active`, `resolved`
- review decision: `accepted`, `conditionally_accepted`,
  `changes_requested`, `rejected`
- decision status: `proposed`, `accepted`, `superseded`, `rejected`
- artifact status: `draft`, `review`, `accepted`, `superseded`
- escalation status: `open`, `in_review`, `resolved`, `closed_no_action`
- task revision: at least 1
- a task cannot depend on itself

### Foreign Keys And Delete Actions

- session agent, task creator/assignees/claims, evidence actor, message sender,
  reviewer, decision owner, artifact owner/reviewers, escalation raiser, and
  audit actor reference `agents.id`
- claim session and audit session reference `agent_sessions.id`
- task-owned assignees, claims, dependencies, evidence, and artifact-task links
  cascade when the task is deleted
- message and review task references become null when the task is deleted
- dependency target tasks use restrictive deletion
- artifact task/reviewer links cascade when the artifact is deleted

All CLI connections enable foreign-key enforcement.

### Required Indexes

- `idx_tasks_status_priority(status, priority, updated_at)`
- `idx_agent_sessions_agent_status(agent_id, status, last_seen_at)`
- `idx_task_assignees_agent(agent_id, task_id)`
- `idx_task_claims_agent(agent_id, claimed_at)`
- `idx_evidence_task(task_id)`
- `idx_reviews_task(task_id, created_at)`
- `idx_messages_recipient(recipient, created_at)`
- `idx_escalations_status(status, created_at)`
- `idx_audit_session(session_id, created_at)`

### Required Triggers

- `task_insert_done_requires_evidence`: tasks cannot be created as done
- `task_claim_requires_active_session`: a claim requires the same active actor
  and session
- `task_claim_requires_claimable_state`: a claim requires `todo`, `review`, or
  `blocked`
- `task_enter_in_progress_requires_claim`: only a claim can enter
  `in_progress`
- `task_status_requires_next_revision`: a status change increments revision by
  exactly one
- `task_update_done_requires_evidence`: entering `done` requires evidence

`doctor`, backup, and restore also reject unclaimed in-progress tasks, invalid
active claims, done tasks without evidence, and internally inconsistent session
rows. Invariant error details retain at most 100 rows per section and include
`truncated_sections` naming any section with additional findings. Integrity and
foreign-key errors retain at most 10 detail rows while reporting truncation;
foreign-key errors also report the complete violation count.

## Concurrency, Durability, And Retry

Initialized connections use foreign keys, WAL journal mode, `FULL` synchronous
durability, the configured busy timeout, and a shared operational file lock.
Mutations use short `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transactions. Multi-statement reports use
one read snapshot. Restore takes the exclusive operational lock.

Export, backup, and restore stage files in the destination directory, flush
file content, publish atomically, and flush the parent directory. Without
`--force`, export and backup use an atomic create-if-absent publication step;
a racing process cannot cause an overwrite.

Retry rules:

- queries, `version`, `doctor`, and `session heartbeat` are safe to retry
- `init` is safe to retry against an empty or exact supported database
- `task claim` is safe to retry only with the same actor, session, and original
  revision
- a consumed `task status` revision fails and does not apply twice
- export and backup can be retried to a new path; an already published path
  returns `output_exists`
- restore is destructive and is not an idempotent mutation
- callers must inspect current state after an interrupted mutation before
  retrying any other write

Signals handled before publication produce `operation_interrupted`;
transaction and staging cleanup leave no partial mutation. If restore is
interrupted after atomic replacement may have occurred, it performs rollback
and returns `restore_verification_failed` so the rollback outcome is explicit.
