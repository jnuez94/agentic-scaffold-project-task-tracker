# Agentic Project Coordination

<!-- agentic-project-scaffold-lite:start -->

This project uses the SQLite backend from Agentic Project Scaffold Lite.

## Required coordination interface

Use the deterministic coordination CLI for coordination state, or use an
already configured local MCP peer:

```sh
./.agents/agentic-project-scaffold-lite/bin/coordination --help
```

The MCP tools are named `coordination_*` and use the same canonical service
layer, validation, transactions, audit rules, and configured SQLite database as
the CLI. MCP is optional and must be provisioned by a project operator before a
shell-less agent starts; agents must not attempt dependency installation as
part of ordinary coordination work. If neither the CLI nor configured MCP tools
are available, stop and request environment setup instead of creating a second
coordination store.

Do not edit `.coordination/coordination.sqlite3` directly. Do not maintain independent Markdown task records alongside the database.
Treat `docs/cli-contract.md` and `docs/mcp-contract.md` as the machine-interface
contracts. Parse the top-level `ok` field and branch on stable error codes
instead of error messages.

## Required operating loop

Before doing work:

1. Register a stable agent identity if needed, then start a unique execution session through the CLI or equivalent MCP tool.
2. Read your inbox (`inbox list` or `coordination_inbox_list`, owner derived from your session), then list tasks and inspect relevant reviews, decisions, and blockers. Mark the inbox read (`inbox mark-read --cursor HEAD`) once acted on; listing never advances it.
3. Confirm ownership and dependencies before editing shared artifacts.
4. Claim assigned work through the tool before starting.

While doing work:

- Pass the active session as the global `--session ID` option before the entity command, or set `COORDINATION_SESSION`.
- Heartbeat the session (`session heartbeat` or `coordination_session_heartbeat`) during long silent work. A claim is a lease: a session silent for an hour may be recovered and its claimed tasks reclaimed by another actor.
- Use only `todo`, `in_progress`, `review`, `blocked`, and `done`.
- Record consequential decisions instead of relying on chat history.
- Keep secrets, credentials, customer data, and regulated data out of coordination records.
- Request review from the role with the relevant authority.
- State what an approval or artifact does not authorize.

Before claiming completion:

- Confirm acceptance criteria are met.
- Add current evidence through the CLI or `coordination_evidence_add`.
- Move the task to `review` before `done` when review is required.
- Create explicit follow-up tasks for remaining work.
- End the execution session through the CLI or `coordination_session_end` when the agent stops participating.

Use CLI `health` or MCP `coordination_project_status` to identify unowned,
stale, blocked, or evidence-deficient work. Initialization, version checks, and
Markdown export remain CLI-only operational procedures; the audit log is
readable through `audit list` or `coordination_audit_list`, and `summary` or
`coordination_summary` gives consistent counts. Additional guidance is in
`.agents/agentic-project-scaffold-lite/`.
